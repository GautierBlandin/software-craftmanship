Hello and welcome !

This repository is a work in progress (and probably always will be!) of how I perceive software craftmanship. It covers a variety of topics from high-level organizational processes to very low-level details. The references documents include links to books, articles, and videos that I find helpful about a particular topic. The .md docs are personal thoughts about the topic. Feel free to explore !

# How to interview

This doc is a copy paste of a reddit comment about how to interview.

Honestly I think it comes down to a subset of talented engineers who have no idea how to interview well. Here is an example of how senior+ level interviews should be conducted (conducted by Casey Muratori):

Basically it should be a series of increasingly deep and narrow questions about something the candidate has done or is passionate about, and ideally the interviewer has enough knowledge of the domain and context to ask those questions and know whether the answers make sense.

What you want isn’t someone who can whip up a radix tree blindfolded. Any smart person can do that if they study those specific topics enough.

What you want is someone who has worked on a lot of hard problems and is capable of diving very deep into the problem space and emerging with a decent solution that makes sense.

You want them to not only have solved such problems, but also know what the alternatives and tradeoffs were and why they chose that specific version of the solution.

This effectively filters out people who are faking their credentials/expertise along with people who “went along for the ride” while others on their team did the real work.

This requires the interviewer to be engaged and have decent social skills. It requires them to make the interviewee feel relatively comfortable and safe enough to share their raw experiences and opinions with confidence. Turns out not every top-ranking engineer or manager has that skillset. You can’t just put the candidate through an arbitrary checklist and expect an accurate evaluation of their overall competence.
